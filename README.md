The official website for Unhitched Operations

# TODO list
- 4. Point your domain (optional but recommended)
If you own a domain (e.g., unhitchedops.com):

In the repo, click “Add file” → “Create new file.”

Name it CNAME (no extension), and inside put just your domain, e.g.:

unhitchedops.com

Save/commit.

In your domain registrar’s DNS settings, create:

A CNAME record for www pointing to username.github.io.

Optionally use an A/ALIAS/redirect at the root to send unhitchedops.com → www.unhitchedops.com (registrar‑specific).

5. Update content going forward
To change text, click index.html → the pencil icon → edit → “Commit changes.”

The site auto‑rebuilds; refresh after ~30–60 seconds.

If you tell me your business name, tagline, and preferred call‑to‑action (call, text, or “Book now”), I can draft a ready‑to‑paste index.html tailored for you.
