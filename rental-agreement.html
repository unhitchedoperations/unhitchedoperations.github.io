      <h2>Formal Agreement</h2>

      <p>This agreement is made as of the invoice date, by and between Unhitched Operations, LLC, and the customer requesting service/signing, representing the property at the service address provided.</p>

      <p>This agreement will use the words "Dumpster" and "Dump Trailer" interchangeably. "Company" will be used to represent Unhitched Operations, LLC, while "Customer" will be used to represent the signing customer requesting service. Collectively, the "Customer" and "Company" will be referred to as "Parties".</p>

      <h3>Equipment Rental</h3>
      <p>Customer certifies that he or she is either the property owner, has power of attorney for the property owner, or is the licensed contractor/broker for the property. Customer warrants and represents that the location of the dumpster is placed safe from vandalism and damage. Customer may not sublet the dumpster for any reason. Sublet dumpsters will terminate the rental period, incur a $500 fee, and all dump fees will be billed to the Customer.</p>

      <h3>Price and Duration</h3>
      <p>Customer agrees to rent the unit from Company according to the prices and fees set forth at the time of rental. The rental period begins the day the dumpster is dropped off, unless otherwise granted by the Company. Any additional per-day charge must be agreed upon by Company and the Customer will be invoiced accordingly.</p>

      <h3>Additional Fees</h3>
      <p>Customers will receive a second invoice for disposal fees of white goods and other items charged by the landfill. This amount will be invoiced using the original payment method or via a secondary payment link.</p>

      <h3>Weight Limit</h3>
      <p>Customer agrees to restrict tonnage set forth at the time of rental (1 ton). If Customer exceeds the tonnage limit, Customer hereby agrees to pay an additional per tonnage fee set forth at the time of rental for each ton over the included 1 ton.</p>

      <h3>Placement</h3>
      <p>Customer warrants and represents that any location provided by Customer for the dumpster is sufficient to bear the weight and size of the dumpster and any vehicle required to transport the dumpster.

      <h3>Movement</h3>
      <p>The dumpster must not be moved by the customer at any point and time before, during, or after the rental. If the dumpster needs to be moved, the Customer must call Company, and a dry run fee will be assessed to respond and move.

      <h3>Accessibility</h3>

The Customer agrees that each rental period includes 1 ton, no matter the amount of dump and returns received.</p>

      <h3>Loading</h3>
      <p>Debris may not extend above the top rim of the dumpster. The tarp must be able to roll completely over the top without obstruction.
